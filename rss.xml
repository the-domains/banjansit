            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How to beat ransomware: Prevent, don't react</h1><p>Picture this: You've spent the last few weeks working on a tribute video for a friend's 30th wedding anniversary. You collected photos and video clips and edited them together, laying over a soundtrack of their favorite songs. It was a real labor of love.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4c1ebfc85780cdfb9a7fee447903ee502ed81659.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Do I really need anti-malware for my Mac?</h1><p>On the popular Discovery Channel program "Mythbusters," hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman take a legend and deconstruct it to see whether its long-held beliefs are legitimate. They've busted all kinds of myths, from Jimmy Hoffa being buried under Giants Stadium (not true) to the ability to kill someone without a trace using an ice bullet (the bullet vaporizes as soon as the trigger's pulled).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/45a6de05186d0b9790cf807c7e2c26f7748c4df8.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Should you store your data in the cloud?</h1><p>It's pretty simple to understand where a file goes when you save it on your PC. It lives on your hard drive, possibly housed in a set of folders you've created and organized yourself. That file is only stored on your computer, unless you decide to email it to yourself or save it on an external hard drive or USB.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1058ab68d1097bcfb635779fa26bd0dcf106ebbd.jpg"></article>]]></description>
